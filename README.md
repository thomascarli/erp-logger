# Erp Logger

The purpose of this gem is to abstract out the process of logging conversations between our different ERP systems.  Using the Erp Logger we are now able to track conversations in detail and gain additional insight about each step of our requests.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'erp-logger'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install erp-logger

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
